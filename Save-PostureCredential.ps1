.SYNOPSIS
    One-time setup: stores a single admin credential, encrypted, for
    posture_agent.ps1 to use automatically instead of prompting every
    time you check a device.

.DESCRIPTION
    Uses Windows DPAPI (Export-Clixml under the hood) — the resulting
    file can only be decrypted by YOUR Windows account, on THIS machine.
    Copying it to another machine, or another user account on this one,
    produces an unreadable file, not a security hole. Nobody, including
    us in this chat, ever sees the actual password — it goes straight
    from the secure prompt below into the encrypted file.

.EXAMPLE
    .\Save-PostureCredential.ps1
    (prompts once, saves to posture_common_cred.xml next to this script)

    [string]$Path = "$PSScriptRoot\posture_common_cred.xml"

# posture_agent.ps1 re-qualifies a handful of known wrong-scope patterns
# automatically (no prefix, ".\", this machine's own name), but it can
# only reliably do that when it's UNAMBIGUOUS that the prefix is wrong.
# A prefix that's a specific device's IP address (e.g. "10.66.1.11") is
# ambiguous by design — it might genuinely be what you meant. Catching
# it here, once, at save time, is more reliable than guessing at use
# time against every future device.
